# Movie Ratings Network Analysis and Text Analysis

In the project, I have focused tapping on the concepts of network analysis. Using the data of movie reviews, I have built a network with user who have left a review as node and users who have reviewed the same movie connected by an edge.

I have then carried out detailed analysis on the network and also community detection in the overall network.

Furthermore, I have also carried out text analysis on the reviews recevied for each community identified in the netowrk analysis.
